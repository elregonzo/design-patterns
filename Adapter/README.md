# Adapter Pattern

The use case used here was based in my dream of someday open my table tennis online store.

In this example i already opened and had a great success with my store. Now, I am expanding abroad to Peru, in order to do the payments of my store i need to integrate with a Peru service payment(La tiendita). Therefore I use the Adapter pattern. This code also includes an additional branch 'Adapter/normalImplementation' that contains a code that in my vision will be without design patterns
