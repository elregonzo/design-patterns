# Factory Pattern

The use case used here was based in my dream of someday open my table tennis online store.

As example in some momment i will need to create some entities class for the blades that i would sell. Therefore, i will disponibilize some brands in my store. Based on this i use the Factory pattern. This code also includes an additional branch 
'normalImplementation' that contains a code that in my vision will be without design patterns
